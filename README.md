# [MEMORY GAME](https://primarypigments.github.io/memory-game)

Crazy Memory gives space to critical thinking and that helps children and adults nurture their attention to detail. Memory games can improve visual recognition. With many memory games based on spotting differences, or linking two related images, children and the elderly can improve their visual discrimination.

Here's your deployed site as an example:

### UX

At this stage of the game I was more concerned about functionality and smooth gameplay than the overall bells and whistles that design can bring. Even though at this stage the design is simple, it is just enough to attract a large array of users to come and play.

### Colour Scheme

I chose colors that would match the hero image due to its appeal of having fun. So the colors I chose are to lour the user to continue and press the begin game button and play.

- Site Colors
- `#f6f7f2` used for primary text.
- `#035349a1` used for Header and footer background.
- `#272b54` used for shadows.
- `#050505` used for background.
- linear-gradient used for Dialog backdrop.
- Â´#CE17A3Â´
- Â´#5F2E90Â´
- Â´#196BF0Â´
- Â´#35B135Â´
- Button Colors
- Â´#04AA6DÂ´  
- Â´#06e392Â´ 
- Â´#02482eÂ´ used for shadow.
- Â´#04AA6DÂ´ used for border.
- Â´#449b47Â´ used for hover background.

When you add a color to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your color palette later if needed.

Example:
https://coolors.co/04aa6d-06e392-449b47-f6f7f2
https://coolors.co/ce17a3-5f2e90-196bf0-ab81cd
https://coolors.co/f6f7f2-035349-272b54-050505

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) to generate my color palette.

### Typography

Icons

As for icons I decided to use for my website Font Awesome library.

Fonts

I've integrated Google Fonts to find a typeface that compliments the website's aesthetic. For the main text, I've chosen Roboto Mono due to its optimization for readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading environments. I've applied with a "sans-serif" fallback.

Example:

- [Rodoto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Sans-Serif](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/sans_serif) was used as a fallback.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
